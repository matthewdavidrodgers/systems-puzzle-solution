    First thought: readme specifies starting the db with a second command. Isn't the point of compose to abstract and automate it all to one command? (up) Just use depends-on: db
    Start with high level: examine the docker-compose.yml
        Looks like the dbdata volume isn't mounted? Need to look into syntax
        Both the db and the flask app have the same env_file?
        * Syntax not uniform. Volume not quoted for flaskapp. Probably correct, db wrong
        Don't think ports are supposed to be quoted either
        Don't know anything about nginx conf files. Need to research
    Before doing anything, run system. Record errors.
        run --rm removes the container when finished, even though it was used to connect to the db. Maybe not rm, just detach? Or maybe make the file system persistent? Couldn't I just move the db connect to the app?
        Warning: the flaskapp command notes that it was built. To rebuild: docker-compose build or docker-compose up --build
        No other errors or warnings
        Didn't need to create db, saw it was already running
        Nothing from localhost
        Shuts down gracefully
    Looking up example docker-compose.yml file for basic errors
        Version number is double quoted
        Ports are supposed to be quoted (first number is actual machine, second is container)
        Looks like volumes can be quoted or not
